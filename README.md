# Expense-Tracker
A expense tracker that utilizes vanilla Javascript and React, Hooks and Context API 

I would have liked to attempt to track my expenses without the use of an excel sheet or staring at my bank app
so I found a expense tracker tutorial video and decided to give it a shot at trying to build one for my own personal finances
I owe it to him for my learning in creating different projects that test code out and for fun.
